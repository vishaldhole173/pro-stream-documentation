A typical need for a customer is to enable other groups to use the VisionStream platform.

Say, for example, that you have a marketing team which does frequent outreach thought livestreaming, blogging and posting of informative podcasts or videos.

You can onboard that Marketing group as a new VisionStream account by sending an Authorization request to a member of that group.

The Authorization enables that person the ability to establish a brand new VisionStream account, which falls under the Authorizing account.

Authorized accounts maintain their own users, events, breakouts, livestreams, calendars and subdomain portals.

Authorized accounts maintain separate billing and invoicing from the parent account.
