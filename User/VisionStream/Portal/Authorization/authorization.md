A typical need for a customer is to enable other groups within their organization usage of the VisionStream platform.

For example, there may be a marketing team within the organization which conducts frequent outreach via livestreaming, blogging, podcasting and static videos.

You can onboard that group into a new VisionStream account by sending an Authorization request to new user.

These users are called Authorized Users, and inherit full privileges once they have created their new account. 

Like all accounts, Authorized accounts maintain their own users, events, breakouts, livestreams, calendars and subdomain portals.

Authorized accounts also maintain separate billing and invoicing from the parent account.

You can send authorizations invitations to other users, enabling them to create a new VisionStream account.

* Press the '+' icon to Create New Authorization.
    - Enter the name and email address of the user you want to invite.
    - Once the authorization is created, it is marked as 'READY' and can be sent.
    - When the authorization recipient clicks on the link to begin the New Account Onboarding process, the authorization is updated to 'ACCEPTED'.
    - An authorization is marked as 'COMPLETED' when the user has successfully created a new account.
* You can track whether the authorization is 'READY', 'ACCEPTED', or 'COMPLETED'
    - The 'READY' state is designated by an amber icon.
    - The 'ACCEPTED' state is designated by half-amber and green icon.
    - The 'COMPLETED' state is designated by a green icon.

**You can Revoke the authorization before the recipient accepts it. You may re-authorize the user at a later time.**
