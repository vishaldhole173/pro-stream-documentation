A typical need for a customer is to enable other groups within their organization to use the VisionStream platform.

For example, say that you have a marketing team which does frequent outreach thought livestreaming, blogging and posting of informative podcasts or videos.

You can onboard that group in a new VisionStream account by sending an Authorization request to a group member.

The Authorization enables that person the ability to establish a brand new VisionStream account, which will fall under your authorizing account.

Authorized accounts also maintain their own users, events, breakouts, livestreams, calendars and subdomain portals.

Authorized accounts maintain separate billing and invoicing from the parent account.
