# Live Stream

Live Stream view provides admin users with a list of all currently running breakouts, along with their corresponding account name with which that breakout is associated.

## Overview

When we are doing a show for a large client, it is not uncommon for any number of breakouts to be running.

Having a single view which enumerates the currently running breakouts is useful in that it allows the admin the ability to hop into any livestream to assess progress, quality, etc.
