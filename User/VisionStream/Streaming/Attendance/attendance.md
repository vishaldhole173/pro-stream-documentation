* This feature provides attendance tracking for streaming sessions.
* It presents attendance data in the form of a bar graph, showcasing the attendance count for each month of the year allowing users to visualize yearly attendance trends and patterns.
* When a user hovers over a single vertical bar, the attendance count for a month is shown.
* When a specific month is clicked, it further displays attendance details for each breakout that occurred within that month.
  - A breakout refers to a streaming session with a duration ranging from 15 minutes to 4 hours.

## Choosing Ranges

* Users can select the desired year using a dropdown menu.
* Upon selecting the year, the app retrieves attendance data for that particular year.
* When clicking on any vertical bar, the user can even apply filtering month wise to view attendance for each breakout that occurred within that month.

## Choosing Breakouts

* When clicking on any breakout horizontal bar, the user can further view the number of attendees who joined at a particular moment for the selected breakout.

## Attendee geographic locations

In addition to viewing attendance trends, you can view an attendee's precise geographic location. 
Choosing the 'show map' control will result in the display of a world map where attendee's physical locations are displayed. Clicking on the map marker will yield the attendees name and exact location.
