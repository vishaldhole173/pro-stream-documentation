- The Analytics feature allows you to view the analytics data generated by users while attending your events.
- VisionStream does not track attendee's'personal data. VisionStream only collects a user's system or device-related data and only while attending an event.

### Show all analytics

- If you enable the toggle switch located at the end of the "Show all analytics" section, all analytics data will be shown. This means you can view analytics data starting from your account origin date.
- However, please note that when you turn on the "Show all analytics" toggle, the "Show" option on the top right side will be disabled.
- It will become active again once you turn off the toggle switch, allowing you to choose a specific timeframe or range for displaying analytics data.

### Show range selections

- The "Show" option located in the top right corner serves the purpose of displaying analytics data for a specific time period.
- It allows you to choose and view analytics for various predefined timeframes such as "Today," "Yesterday," or "Last Year."
- By selecting a particular timeframe, you can focus on the analytics data specifically generated during that period.
