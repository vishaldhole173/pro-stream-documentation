# Payments

Payments view allows you to see payments which you have collected over the entire range of your account.

## Overview

Assigning a Charge value to a breakout will automatically invoke a payment step during your user's access to the live stream. Likewise, if no payment is required, you can easily configure a `Tip Jar` to your breakout, in which case it will invoke similarly the payment form.
