Assigning a charge amount to a breakout will automatically invoke a payment step during your user's access to the live stream, or an on-demand recording. Likewise, you can also configure a `Tip Jar` to be shown during the checkout process, which results in a `donation` page displayed before the final payment form. 

The Payments page displays payments made from breakouts generating payments from a [subdomain portal](../Subdomains/events.md), as well as paid `Invoice` charges.

## Payment record fields
* Name 
  - The "Payer Name" will be prominently shown at the beginning, followed by the breakout or invoice name for which the user made a payment.
* Amount

    - Admin users have the ability to search for a specific records using the payer's name, and they can also view the records in a sorted order with respect to name, amount and date.
