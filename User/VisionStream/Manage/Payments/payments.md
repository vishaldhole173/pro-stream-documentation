Assigning a charge value to a breakout will automatically invoke a payment step during your user's access to the live stream. Likewise, if no payment is required, you can easily configure a `Tip Jar` to your breakout, in which case it will invoke similarly to the payment form. 

The payments page displays payments made from breakouts generating payments from a [subdomains](../Subdomains/events.md), and the Invoices page.

## Payment record fields
* Name 
  - The "Payer Name" will be prominently shown at the beginning, followed by the relevant breakout name for which the user made a payment.
* Amount
  - The "Amount" field indicates amount paid by payer/person for respective breakout.
* Date
  - The "Date" field denotes the specific date when the payment was made. Admin users have the ability to search for a specific record using the payer's name, and they can also view the records in a sorted order with respect to name, amount and date.
