A subdomain (or Portal) allows you to create a unique web URL that you can distribute to your attendees. This not only provides a personalized and branded web address but also gives you the flexibility to customize the user interface (UI) elements, such as colors, to align with your branding preferences.

VisionStream will manage the entire flow within your subdomain, including authentication and payments.

* Your end users will:
  - Navigate to your calendar which displays your published events.
  - Choose an event.
  - Continue to an overview page containing event specifics and details.
  - Perform authentication (Sign In).
  - Handles donation & charges if applicable.
  - Choose a breakout and continue to the live stream viewer.

* A subdomain portal can display any number of events on the subdomain's home page, or the subdomain's calendar. 
    - To appear in the event listing home page or the calendar, the event must first be 'Published'.
    - When setting up a subdomain, there is a section where you can export events fom your account.
      - Events which are not yet published appear in grey text, but are still candidates to be exported (though not yet visible). 

As an admin user, clicking on a subdomain's title will redirect you to the subdomain's [main events](./events.md) home page.

* To provide access to anonymous or ad-hoc users, admin users can apply the [allow guest login](./users.md) feature which allows anonymous users the ability to access the subdomain portal.
