A subdomain allows you to create a unique web URL that you can distribute to your attendees. This not only provides a personalized and branded web address but also gives you the flexibility to customize the user interface (UI) elements, such as colors, to align with your branding preferences. 

Likewise, you can embed a subdomain into your website to redirect users to your live-stream event.

You can edit any Subdomain and change the values of all fields except the Subdomain and Redirect URL.

## Events

A subdomain can display any number of events on the subdomain's event listing page, or the subdomain's calendar. To appear in the Event listing page or the calendar, the Event must first be 'Published'. However, in the Event section of setting up a subdomain, you can choose any Event you have created.

After clicking on the subdomain link button, you will redirect to the tenant [events](./events.md) page.

To provide access to anonymous or ad-hoc users, admin users can [create new user](./users.md) accounts by signing into their account.
