# Subdomains

A sub-domain allows you to create a unique web URL which you can distribute to your attendees.

Likewise, you can embed a sub-domain into your own website to redirect users to your live stream event.

## Overview

VisionStream will manage the entire flow within your sub-domain, including authentication and payments.

* Your end users will:
  - Navigate to your calendar which displays your published events.
  - Choose an event.
  - Continue to an overview page containing event specifics and details.
  - Perform authentication (Sign In).
  - Choose a breakout and continue to the live stream viewer.
