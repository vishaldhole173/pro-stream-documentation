A subdomain (or Portal, or Subdomain Portal) is what your end-users - attendees -  will ultimately interact with. It is essentially the entryway to viewing your published content, including:

- Event listings & calendars
- Livestream performances
- Blog postings
- Sponsorship collateral
- Channel videos
- On-demand recordings

Admin users create subdomains with unique URLs, and can style a subdomain portal with branded content such as logos, colors and graphics.

VisionStream will manage the entire flow within your subdomain, including authentication and payments.

* Viewers will:
  - Navigate to your portal calendar which displays your published events.
  - Choose an event.
  - Continue to an overview page containing event specifics and details.
  - Perform authentication (Sign In).
  - Apply donation and / or event charges if applicable.
  - Choose a breakout and continue to the live stream viewer.
    - If the breakout has completed, the user is instead navigated to the on-demand recording.

### Assigning Events to your Subdomain Portal

To assign events to your subdomain portal, click the Next button, or click the navigation link Select Events at the top right of the page titled 'Create Subdomain'.

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishaldhole173/pro-stream-documentation/main/fontawesome/svgs/solid/flag.svg" width="20" height="20"> Events

* A subdomain portal can display any number of events on the subdomain's home page, or the subdomain's calendar, provided the event is 'Published'. 
- When setting up a subdomain, you will be asked to indicate which events you want displayed in the home page and calendar.
  - Events which are not yet published appear in grey text, but are still candidates for selection. 

As an admin user, clicking on a subdomain's title will redirect you to the [subdomain's home page](./events.md).

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishaldhole173/pro-stream-documentation/main/fontawesome/svgs/solid/users.svg" width="20" height="20"> Users

* Users are normally imported directly into an account.
  - An admin user also has the ability to add users one-at-a-time.
* To provide access to anonymous or ad-hoc users, admin users can apply the [allow guest login](./users.md) feature to any event, which allows anonymous users the ability to access your subdomain portal.
