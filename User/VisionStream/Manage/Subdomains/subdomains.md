A subdomain (or Portal) is what your end-users will ultimately interact with. It is essentially the entryway to viewing your published content, including:

- Event listings
- Livestream performances
- Blog postings
- Sponsorship materials
- Channel videos
- On-demand recordings

Admin users create subdomains with unique URLs, and can style a subdomain portal with branded content such as logos, colors and graphics.

VisionStream will manage the entire flow within your subdomain, including authentication and payments.

* Your end users will:
  - Navigate to your portal calendar which displays your published events.
  - Choose an event.
  - Continue to an overview page containing event specifics and details.
  - Perform authentication (Sign In).
  - Apply donation and / or event charges if applicable.
  - Choose a breakout and continue to the live stream viewer.
    - If the breakout has completed, the user is instead navigated to the on-demand recording.

You can edit any Subdomain and change the values of all fields except the Subdomain and Redirect URL.

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishaldhole173/pro-stream-documentation/main/fontawesome/svgs/solid/flag.svg" width="20" height="20"> Events

* A subdomain portal can display any number of events on the subdomain's home page, or the subdomain's calendar, provided it is 'Published'. 
  - When setting up a subdomain, you will be asked to indicate which events you want displayed in the home page and calendar.
    - Events which are not yet published appear in grey text, but are still candidates to be shown (though not yet visible). 

As an admin user, clicking on a subdomain's title will redirect you to the [subdomain's home page](./events.md).

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishaldhole173/pro-stream-documentation/main/fontawesome/svgs/solid/users.svg" width="20" height="20"> Users

* To provide access to anonymous or ad-hoc users, admin users can apply the [allow guest login](./users.md) feature on any event, which allows anonymous users the ability to access the subdomain portal.
