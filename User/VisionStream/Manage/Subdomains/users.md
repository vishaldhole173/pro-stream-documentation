Attendee Login options are set at the Event.

### Attendee Login Options

VisionStream Events are made available to your attendees via a VisionStream subdomain portal.
There are several different login scenarios you can employ at the attendee login screen to allow access to your content.

* Login Options:
    - Default
        - The default behavior once you have imported your attendees directly into your account, and prefer to restrict viewership to only those attendees. The attendee only has to enter their email address to gain access to your published event.
    - Allow Guest Login
        - Use this option if you wish to provide anonymous attendees the ability to add themselves to your attendee list.
            - Attendees will be required to authenticate themselves using a valid email address.
    - Require Authentication
        - Requires ALL attendees to authenticate themselves ONE TIME before access is granted to an Event.
            - Offers heightened security by ensuring the attendee is actually who they claim to be.
