## Transcription

Transcription is an essential and valuable feature, benefiting both content creators and viewers in several ways:

**Accessibility and Inclusivity:** By providing real-time transcriptions during live streams or automatic transcriptions for recorded content, Vision Stream ensures that people with hearing impairments can fully enjoy the content. It promotes inclusivity, allowing a broader audience to engage with the material.

**Enhanced User Experience:** Viewers may sometimes face challenges understanding certain accents, technical jargon, or fast-paced speech during live streams. Transcriptions help to overcome these obstacles by offering a written version of the spoken words, improving comprehension and overall user experience.

**Improved SEO and Discoverability:** Transcripts allow search engines to index the content of the stream more effectively. This means that the streamed content becomes searchable based on its actual spoken words, leading to better SEO and discoverability for the stream and the platform hosting it.

**Content Repurposing:** Transcripts provide an easily accessible textual version of the streamed content. Content creators can leverage this text to create blog posts, articles, or social media posts based on the stream's key points. This repurposing of content helps extend its reach and engagement on various platforms.

**Study and Analysis:** Streamers can use transcriptions to review their own content, identify areas for improvement, and understand viewer preferences. Additionally, researchers or analysts may use transcriptions to study and gain insights from live discussions or interviews conducted through the streaming software.

**Real-time Interaction:** During live streams, viewers can benefit from real-time transcriptions, allowing them to follow the conversation more closely and actively participate in discussions, chats, or Q&A sessions without missing any crucial points.

**Legal Compliance and Archiving:** In certain contexts, such as corporate meetings or official broadcasts, transcriptions serve as legally valid records of what was said. Vision Stream transcription capabilities can facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements and aid in archiving important content.

**Language Learning and Localization:** Transcriptions assist language learners in understanding and studying spoken language by providing written text alongside the audio. Additionally, transcriptions can be useful for localizing content to reach international audiences in their native languages.

**Highlighting Key Moments:** With the help of transcriptions, viewers can easily find and revisit specific sections of the stream. They can search for keywords or topics of interest, allowing them to skip to relevant sections quickly.

In summary, transcription significantly enhances the overall streaming experience by promoting accessibility, discoverability, and user engagement. It opens up new possibilities for content creators and allows viewers to interact with and enjoy the content more effectively.

### Subtitles for MP4 recordings

Currently, we are supporting subtitles for MP4 recordings.

Once you have completed streaming your breakout, VisionStream will start processing your stream to generate an MP4 recording and transcription if that option is chosen. Once generating these assets have completed, you can play the MP4 recording along with subtitles, as well as download your transcription. Though generating the MP4 recording takes some time, still you can enjoy viewing the HLS stream immediately after the show.
