As an Authorized Signer, you can invite other users into your account to help you administer to it.

* Press the '+' icon to Create New Invitation.
    - Enter the name and email address of the user you want to invite.
    - Once the invitation is created, it is marked as 'READY' and can be sent.
    - When the invitation recipient clicks on the link to begin the sign-up process, the invitation is updated to 'ACCEPTED'.
    - An invitation is marked as 'COMPLETED' when the user has successfully joined the account.
* You can track whether the invitation is 'READY', 'ACCEPTED', or 'COMPLETED'
    - The 'READY' state is designated by an amber icon.
    - The 'ACCEPTED' state is designated by half-amber and green icon.
    - The 'COMPLETED' state is designated by a green icon.
