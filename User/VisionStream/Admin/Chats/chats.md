In the past, we have encountered team members utilizing the chat feature to communicate with each while setting up a livestream.

Having the ability to delete chat records before a livestream begins (or at any time during a livestream) has proven to be very useful.

* Press the trash icon to the right of the chats count on the Chats listing page.
  - The application will prompt the user to confirm their intention to delete chat history.
    - This confirmation step is crucial as the action cannot be undone.
  - Upon confirmation, the application permanently removes all chat records for the breakout session.

**WARNING: All chat records for the breakout will be deleted. This operation cannot be reverted!**
