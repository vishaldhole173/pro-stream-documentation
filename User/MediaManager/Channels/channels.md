A Channel in VisionStream is a collection of videos, usually of a related topic, which can be accessed via a Channel Name tag you assign a video during upload.

* When a user submits files to MediaManager, if there is a video (MP4) file in the upload group, the user can navigate to the Channel setup panel.
    * The user can then tag the file(s) with an existing Channel name, or enter a new name.

After the video is uploaded to MediaManager, it can be found by clicking the `Find by Channel` item under the Find header.

All the channels maintained by MediaManager for your account will be listed. Clicking on the channel name will yield the contents of the channel.
