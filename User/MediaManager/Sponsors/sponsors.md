A Sponsor is an organizational construct which you can use to organize and group related files.

Sponsors can be assigned to any MediaManager upload. The Sponsor tag can then be used in a MediaManager search.

Sponsor searches can be assigned to an Event. Consequently, when a user navigates to the Event's Subdomain portal, the Sponsor link is available and will show all sponsor-related files when clicked.

For example, suppose you assigned a grouping of upload files to sponsor "Big Show Sponsor". These files detailed various discounts, promotions, etc. for that sponsor.

A search can then be constructed to find these files by assigning the "Big Show Sponsor" as a search parameter to a saved search.

The saved search can be assigned to any Event.

When a user navigates to the Event, they will see the Sponsor link, which they can click to reveal the "Big Show Sponsor" files.
