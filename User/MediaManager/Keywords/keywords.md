A Keyword is an organizational construct which you can use to organize and group related files.

Keywords can be used to further group files when creating searches for use in your livestream presentations.

For example, suppose you have three breakouts, and sponsor "A Big Sponsor" wants to provide topical files for each separate livestream.

- A Big Sponsor
  - Introduction
- A Big Sponsor
  - Pledge and commitment
- A Big Sponsor
  - Team

The example above shows 3 separate uploads, containing any number of files each, associated with the Sponsor "A Big Sponsor" and the Keywords
'Introduction', 'Pledge and commitment' and 'Team'. 

For breakout 1, we could create a search to show only the 'Introduction' files, using the tags 'A Big Sponsor' and 'Introduction'.

For breakout 2, we could create a search to show only the 'Pledge and commitment' files, using the tags 'A Big Sponsor' and 'Pledge and commitment'.

For breakout 3, we could create a search to show only the 'Introduction' files, using the tags 'A Big Sponsor' and 'Team'.

Or conversely, we could simply create a search using 'A Big Sponsor' which would show all the files associated with that tag.
