### MediaManager employs several useful tag and filter methodologies:

* When a user submits files to MediaManager, the following steps occur:
  - All files are listed in the Upload panel, displaying the file name, type and size.
  - The user can then navigate to the Sponsor panel.
  - The user can tag the file(s) with an existing Sponsor name, or enter a new name.
  - The user can then navigate to the Project panel.
  - The user can tag the file(s) with an exising Project name, or enter a new name.
  - The user can then navigate to the Keywords panel.
  - The user can tag the file(s) with existing keywords, or enter new keywords.
  - If there is a video (Mp4) file in the upload, the user can navigate to the Channels panel.
      - The user can tag the file(s) with an existing Channel name, or enter a new name.

After upload, the index lookups in MediaManager are updated to reflect the new additions. MediaManager keeps track of the last 20 Sponsor, Project and Keyword tags that have been utilized and displays them prominently in the UI. Showing all files which have been grouped by these various tags is easy via a simple click.

All admin users in the same account will have visibility into everyone's Sponsor, Project and Keyword tags. This makes it easy for groups of people working with different documents and potentially different divisions to keep the organization structure well-defined and organized.

### Other useful high-level filters:

* Besides the Sponsor, Project and Keyword filters mentioned above, there are several other useful filters:
  - By Favorite
    - MediaManager allows users the ability to mark any file as a 'Favorite'.
  - Recently Uploaded
    - MediaManager keeps track of the 100 most recently uploaded files.
  - By User
    - Find all files uploaded by any user in your account.
  - By Channel
    - Find all files associated with any Channel in your account.
  - By Date or Type
    - Find all files by date (month) or by the file's type.

All filters are presented in a very easy to read table. Filters are organized and grouped alphabetically. Hovering or tapping on any filter will display the number of file associated with each filter.
