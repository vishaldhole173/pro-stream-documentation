* In MediaManager, under the `Find` heading, click the item titled `Recently Uploaded`.
    * You will see an index page of up-to 100 files from your account, sorted and grouped alphabetically.
    * Locate the user whose uploads you wish to view.

The Recently Uploaded feature is especially useful when you need to keep track of the latest uploads or when collaborating with other users who may have added new files to MediaManager.
