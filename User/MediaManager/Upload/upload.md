Files can be uploaded to MediaManager using the file uploader.

You can drag files directly from your desktop and drop them into the currently open drive.

The File Upload dialog will appear. This is where you will configure the upload:

Assign file by:
- Project
- Sponsor
- Keywords

You can write a brief description which will apply to all files in the upload session.
