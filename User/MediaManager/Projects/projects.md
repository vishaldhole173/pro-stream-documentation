A Project is an organizational construct which you can use to organize and group related files.

In our own internal usage, we have found it convenient to organize files with a top-level term, like the name of an upcoming show.

From there, we can assign further lookup terms using keywords.

For example:

- A Really Big Show
  - Contracts
- A Really Big Show
  - User Import Files
- A Really Big Show
  - Wiring diagrams

The example above shows 3 separate uploads, containing any number of files, associated with the Project "A Really Big Show" and the Keywords "Contracts", "User Import Files" and "Wiring diagrams" respectively."
