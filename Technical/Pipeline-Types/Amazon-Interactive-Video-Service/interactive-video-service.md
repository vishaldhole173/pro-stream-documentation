AWS IVS, or Amazon Interactive Video Service, is a fully managed live-streaming solution offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables developers to add interactive, low-latency video streaming capabilities to their applications and websites, allowing them to deliver high-quality live video content to a wide range of devices and platforms.

IVS simplifies the process of building, managing, and scaling live video applications by providing a set of powerful APIs and SDKs. It takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including video ingest, transcoding, storage, and delivery, so developers can focus on creating engaging live video experiences for their users.

Key features of AWS IVS include:

1. Live-streaming: IVS allows you to stream live video from various sources, such as cameras, professional encoding equipment, or software encoders. It supports a wide range of streaming protocols, including WebRTC, RTMP, and HLS.

2. Low-latency streaming: IVS is designed for real-time interactions and offers sub-second latency, enabling applications that require minimal delay between the live event and viewer experience. This makes it suitable for applications like interactive gaming, auctions, sports events, and more.

3. Scalability and reliability: IVS automatically scales to accommodate viewership spikes without any upfront provisioning or capacity planning. It leverages the global infrastructure of AWS, ensuring high availability and reliability for your live streams.

4. Interactive features: IVS supports various interactive features to engage viewers during live streams. It provides real-time chat functionality, allowing viewers to communicate with each other and the streamer. It also supports polls, Q&A, and synchronized graphics to enhance viewer engagement.
